    "# Integer Linear Programming for the CVRP\n",
    "In our formulation, we have a fleet of $F$ identical vehicles each with some capacity $Q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and a graph $(V,E)$ of $N$ nodes each having placed an order of size $C_i$ with distances $d_{ij}$ between nodes $i$ and $j$. The 0th node is the depot, where all routes must start and end, and the problem is to find routes of the vehicles such that all demands are met, and such that some objective 'cost' function is minimised. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_{ijk}$ be binary variables where $x_{ijk} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ if vehicle } k \\text{ travels along the edge }E_{ij} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if not}\\end{cases}$, then the cost funciton is taken to be \n",

    "- Each vehicle must exit a node that it enters: For all vehicles $k$, and all nodes $j$ we have \n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i} x_{ijk} - \\sum_{i} x_{jik} =  0$$\n",
    "- We can then impose that all non-depot nodes $j$ must be entered exactly once by some vehicle (note: in some formulations of this problem this can be relaxed, ie. we can skip customers if getting to them is a major hassle, we shall not neglect our customers in such a way. One could spend a lifetime going through every different formulation of VRP - hence our methods are focussed on only one instance!):\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i,k} x_{ijk} =1, \\text{ where } j>0$$\n",
    "-  Moreover, all vehicle's routes should leave (equivalently, by the first condition, return to) the depot:\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j} x_{0jk } =1$$\n",

    "Coolio, however there is a minor (major?!) problem in that this formulation allows for 'subtours' to arise. The are two standard ways to try and eliminate subtours, one due to Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ), and the other due to Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson (DFJ). \n",
    "\n",
    "The fist method (MTZ) introduces new variables $u_i$ to fix the problem - essentially giving each node a 'running count' if it's been visited, which has to be increasing. The second method (DFJ) introduces *loads* of contraints (one for each subset of the vertices) to ensure that this subset doesn't have a closed loop. For example for a subset $S \\subset V$, one can impose that the number of edges travelled between nodes must be strictly less than the number of nodes in that subset. In fact, due to our other constraints above this can be written as \n",

    "Anyhoo, since ILP is an NP-hard problem, solving CVRP this way is not particularly scalable, so we dont want to invest too much time here. Rather than working from the ground up, we shall use the PuLP library for optimistaion. "
