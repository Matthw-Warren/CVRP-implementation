#Use of exact methods is not actually feasible due to the size of the problem. So our implementation here will focus in heuristic methods. 

#Let's first try and implement a constructive heuristic - First we begin with a nearest neighbour heuristic - which is a greedy method.

#First to each vehicle we will attach a rout .
#2-Opt algorithm, which removes route crossings - good because drivers dont like to overleap routes
